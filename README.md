In this project you can find the slides and the code I made for my lecture on Local Polynomial Regression.

[Local Polynomial Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression) is a powerful regression technique extensively used for scatterplot smoothing with the method of Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS), that is the the default in `ggplot2::geom_smooth()` function in R.

In the lecture I presented the idea behind Local Polynomial Regression and some of its benefits.
